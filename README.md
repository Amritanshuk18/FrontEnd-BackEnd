# FrontEnd-BackEnd
The project aims to create a simple and effective to-do list application with a React frontend and a Django backend. The backend API, built with Django REST Framework, enables CRUD operations, while the React frontend provides a user-friendly interface with form validation and actions for managing to-do items.
